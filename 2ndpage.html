              Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, launched in 1972 and 1973,
              respectively, were the first spacecraft to visit the solar
              system's most photogenic gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Pioneer
              10 was the first probe to travel through the solar system's
              asteroid belt, a field of orbiting rocks between Mars and Jupiter.
              Then about a year-and-a-half after its launch, the spacecraft made
              the first flyby of the planet Jupiter.

              Shortly after the Pioneers made their flybys, the Voyager 1 and
              Voyager 2 probes followed. They made many important discoveries
              about Jupiter and Saturn, including rings around Jupiter and the
              presence of volcanism on Jupiter's moon, Io. Voyager went on to
              make the first flybys of Uranus, where it discovered 10 new moons,
              and Neptune, where it found that Neptune actually weighs less than
              astronomers thought.

              Another spacecraft with a profound effect on cosmology and
              astrophysics is the Spitzer Space Telescope, which observed the
              heavens through infrared light. This light, which has a longer
              wavelength than visual light, is mostly blocked by Earth's
              atmosphere. In addition to taking gorgeous photos of galaxies,
              nebulae and stars, the telescope has made numerous groundbreaking
              scientific discoveries.

              NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
              NASA is a U.S. government agency that is responsible for science
              and technology related to air and space. The Space Age started in
              1957 with the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik. NASA opened
              for business on Oct. 1, 1958. The agency was created to oversee
              U.S. space exploration and aeronautics research. The administrator
              is in charge of NASA. The NASA administrator is nominated by the
              president and confirmed by a vote in the Senate.

            <p id="workingpara">
              NASAâ€™s Headquarters is in Washington, D.C. The agency has nine
              centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and seven test and research
              facilities located in several states around the country. More than
              17,000 people work for NASA. Many more people work with the agency
              as government contractors. These people are hired by companies
              that NASA pays to do work. The combined workforce represents a
              variety of jobs. Astronauts may be the best-known NASA employees,
              but they only represent a small number of the total workforce.
              Many NASA workers are scientists and engineers. But people there
              hold many other jobs, too, from secretaries to writers to lawyers
              to teachers.
